Problem: 
Given the current situation, most companies have asked their employees to work from home instead of being physically present in the office. This has led to employees spending most of their day seated in one position and not really moving around. In addition to this, the whole work-from-home situation has caused a huge social rift between co-workers as opposed to the dynamic workspace culture they’re used to where they would take frequent breaks between their work to have bonding sessions with their co-workers. Be it playing a sport, or spending time in the lounge or playing a board game, they always found a way to connect. So the major two problems we’re highlighting here are: 
-Fitness: Employees aren’t moving around as much as they used to, which has reduced their physical activity leading to a decrease in the attention paid to health and fitness. 
-Co-worker relationships: As we have highlighted earlier, the current situation has led to employees not interacting with each other outside of “work” conversations. 
Solution: 
-A web application that assigns a certain number of fitness related challenges and tasks every few hours.

-These tasks and challenges are group based within the company so as to motivate the employees to complete the tasks. 
-This creates an environment for co-workers to bond with each other, and we plan to include a point based system to also bring out the competitive spirit amongst them and encourage them to finish their tasks on time.

- The tasks will be simple and short 10-20 minute ones and may include stress-busters like meditation, yoga etc. or employees could opt for a more intense workout task. -This reminds them to take a break every once in a while while simultaneously helping them interact with their colleagues.
